Hello Arael! This is where you should start. I wont try to explain the process in the readme as I think that will just complicate
things too much, so I put it in the code so you can see whats happening and where. I detailed the process in each part
and it leads you to the next part after each explination. Start with the PokemonController.cs class,
you can find it in the Controllers folder in BillsPC_CleanArchitecture.Api.
If you have any questions or want to go over anything, just reach out to me in the discord, or send me a 
screenshot of anythign you're unsure about.

The database portion requires you to have a SQL Server Database.
