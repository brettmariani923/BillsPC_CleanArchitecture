    <p>
        Welcome to my Pokémon Database! This website provides detailed information on all Pokémon species up to Generation 8, covering a total of 926 Pokémon.
    </p>

    <p>
        The base stats and all other Pokémon data — such as types, abilities, and additional attributes — are stored in the bottom of the application. These are bulk inserts for your database. This database contains every column of information except for the images.
        You will have to update the settings in appsettings.json to connect to your database.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pokémon images are dynamically retrieved from <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokeAPI</a>, a reliable public API that provides official artwork and sprites.
		Because we are pulling over 900 images from PokeAPI, the first time you select View All Pokemon, it can take up to 120 seconds. After this the files will be cached within the application, and it will be much faster on subsequent requests.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help with searches, if you’re unsure of the exact spelling of a Pokémon's name, just type the first letter or part of the name and the site will suggest results close to your input.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to provide an easy-to-navigate, searchable, and accurate resource for Pokémon fans and collectors. I hope you find it useful!
